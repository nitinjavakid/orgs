* What is Machine Learning?
  * Identifying patterns when given input + output*
  * Using identified patterns to predict output given unseen input
* Types of Machine learning
  * Supervised learning - Outputs are given
    * Trying to identify pattern for computing output
    * Regression/Classification
  * Unsupervised learning - Outputs are not given
    * Identifying how to meaningfully divide data instances
    * Clustering
* What are inputs/outputs?
  * A record is one instance of data i.e row within a CSV
  * Each record will have field that will the target value.
    * Example: Price of house
  * Fields other than target value will be potential inputs.
    * Example: No of rooms, Carpet Area, Locality
** Input types
  1. Quantitative
  2. Categorical
  3. Ordinal
** Output types
  1. Quantitative (Regression)
  2. Categorical (Classification)

* Machine Learning Loop

** Understanding domain
  * Given a problem statement, understand how inputs might affect the output
  * Check if given data is enough for modeling or you need more input features
  * For example: Is absence of locality critical for housing price estimator?
  * Define how you would evaluate the performance of system

** Feature Engineering/Data processing
  * Handle missing inputs/outputs.
  * Handle outliers.
  * Handle redundant features.
  * Apply functions of features.

** Model training
  * Create separate train, test and validate datasets.
  * Perform training and testing until you achieve acceptable levels of accuracy or other applicable measures.
  * Perform final test against validation dataset.

** Interpret results
  * Use evaluation methods to identify how well the model does against validation set.
  * If multiple models have been trained, reason which one is better than the other.

** Deploy models
  * Deploy in production for predictions.

* Supervised learning algorithms
  * Classification
    * To classify input into two or more categories
    * Example: Images to alphabets(categories)
  * Regression
    * Calculate numerical output given the inputs
    * Example: Calculate price of house

** Classification algorithms
   1. Logistic Regression
   2. Decision Trees
   3. Support Vector Machines
   4. K-Nearest Neighbors
   5. Artificial Neural Networks

** Regression algorithms
   1. Linear Regression
   2. Support Vector Regression
